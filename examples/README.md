# Dockerfile Examples

- each directory contains an example `Dockerfile` and a `README.md`
- the `README.md` must include the source and license of the published Dockerfile, and the author; it should also include comments or notes, and a few keywords or a descriptive abstract that searching the repository gives reasonable results
- the directory name should contain scientific domain (e.g. `neuroscience`, `sedimentology`) and the main workflow language(s) or tool(s) (e.g. `Python`, `R-tidyverse`, `pandas`)
