  Containers are greatly improving computational science by packaging software and data dependencies.
  In a scholarly context, transparency and support of reproducibility are the largest drivers for using these containers.
  It follows that choices that are made with respect to building containers can make or break a worklow's reproducibility.
  The build for the container image is often created based on the instructions in a plain-text file.
  For example, one such container technology, Docker, provides instructions using a `Dockerfile`.
  By following the rules in this article researchers writing a `Dockerfile` can effectively build and distribute containers.

# Introduction {#introduction .unnumbered}

With access to version control systems (VCS, @wikipedia_contributors_version_2019) and only collaboration platforms based on these, such as [GitHub](https://github.com) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), it has become increasingly easy to not only share algorithms, but also instructions for executing research workflows, including building and testing of the used software.
The publication of these artefacts are a response to the increasing complexity of computer-based research, which is too complicated for "papers" to fully communicate the knowledge [@marwick_how_2015] but where the actual knowledge is the full software environment that produced a result [@donoho_invitation_2010].
A _research compendium_ is a compilation of data, code, and documentation that accompanies, or is itself, a scholarly publication for increased transparency and reproducibility (cf. [https://research-compendium.science](https://research-compendium.science)).
Within such a compendium, it is suggested to include instructions, i.e. a human- and machine-readable recipe, for buiding containers that capturw the computing environment, i.e., all software and data dependencies.
By way of providing this recipe, authors of scientific articles greatly improve documentation and apply one important part of common practices for scientific computing [@wilson_best_2014; @wilson_good_2017], with the result that it is much more likely both the author and third parties are able to reproduce an analysis workflow.
The containers built from these recipes are portable encapsulated snapshots of a specific computing environment.
Such containers have been demonstrated for capturing scientific notebooks [@rule_ten_2019] and reproducible workflows (cf. Rule 10 of @sandve_ten_2013).

While there are several tutorials for using containers for reproducible research [@nust_author_2017; @chapman_reproducible_2018; @ropensci_labs_r_2015; @udemy_docker_2019; @psomopoulos_lesson_2017], there is no extensive examination for how to write the actual instructions to create the containers.
Several platforms for facilitating reproducible research are built on top of containers [@brinckman_computing_2018; @code_ocean_2019; @simko_reana_2019; @jupyter_binder_2018; @nust_opening_2017], but they hide any complexity from the researcher.
Because _"the number of unique research environments approximates the number of researchers"_ [@nust_opening_2017], sticking to conventions helps every researcher to understand, modify, and eventually write container recipes, even if the are not sure how the technology behin them actually works.
Therefore researchers publishing a research compendium should craft their own definition of computing environments following good practices.

While there are many different container technologies, this article focuses on Docker [@wikipedia_contributors_docker_2019].
Docker has been demonstrated as a very suitable tool for reproducible research (e.g., @boettiger_introduction_2017).
The goal at hand is to write a `Dockerfile` so that it best facilitates interactive development and computer-based research as well as the higher goals of reproducibility and preservation of knowledge.
Such practices are not part of generic containerisation tutorials and are not present in published Dockerfiles, which are often used as templates by novices.
The differences between a helpful stable Dockerfile and one that is misleading, prone to failure, and full of potential obstacles, are not obvious, especially for researchers who don't have software development experience.

We assume you have a scripted scientific workflow, i.e. you can, at least at a certain point in time, execute the full process with a single command.
This execution should be able to be triggered by command-line instruction, which is possible for all generic programming languages and widely used workflow tools, but may also be opening and starting a process with a graphical user interface.
A workflow that does not support scripted execution is out of scope for reproducible research and does fit well with containerisation. 

A commitment to these general practices can ensure that workflows are reproducible, and generation of a container is not merely triggered by the publication of a finished project (cf. thoughts on openness as an afterthought by @chen_open_2019 and on computational reproducibility by @donoho_invitation_2010).
By following the _conventions_ layed out in these ten rules, authors ensure readability by others and enable subsequent reuse and collaboration.

## Docker {#docker .unnumbered}

Docker is a container technology that is widely adopted and supported on many platforms, and has become highly useful in science.
They are distinct from virtual machines (VM) or hypervisors as they do not emulate hardware, and thus do not require the same system resources.
To build Docker containers, we write text files that follow a particular format called `Dockerfile`s [@docker_inc_dockerfile_2019]. 
`Dockerfile`s are machine- and human-readable recipes for creating containers.
While Docker was the original technology to support this format, other container technologies have developed around the format (and thus support it) including: [podman](https://podman.io/)/[buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah) supported by RedHat, [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko), [img](https://github.com/genuinetools/img), and [buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit).
The Singularity container software [@kurtzer_singularity_2017] is optimized for high performance computing and although it uses its own format, the _Singularity recipe_, it can import Docker containers directly from a Docker registry. 
Although the Singularity recipe format is different, the rules here are transferable to some extent.
While some may argue for reasons to not publish reproducibly (lack of time & incentives and unfittingness for a researcher's workflow, cf. @boettiger_introduction_2015) and there are substantial technical challenges to maintain software and documentation, providing a `Dockerfile` or pre-built Docker container should become an increasingly easier task for the average researcher.
If a researcher is able to find or create containers or `Dockerfile`s to address their most common use cases, then arguably it will not be extra work after this initial set up (cf. README of @marwick_madjebebe_2015). 
In fact, the `Dockerfile` itself can be used as documentation to clearly show from where data and code was derived, i.e. downloaded or installed, and consequently where a third party might obtain them again.
Importantly, the researcher should clearly state the platforms (by way of one or more Docker containers) have been tested on.

# 1. Consider tools to assist with Dockerfile generation {-}

Writing a Dockerfile from scratch is not that simple, and even "experts" sometimes take shortcuts.
Thus, it's a good strategy to first look to tools that can help to generate a Dockerfile for you.
Such tools have likely thought about and implemented good practices, and they may have added newer practices when reapplied at a later point in time.
It's always a good practice to start with your specific use case.
You would first want to determine if there is an already existing container that you can use, and in this case, use it and add to your workflow documentation instructions for doing so.
As an example, you might be doing some kind of interactive development.
For interactive development environments such as notebooks and development servers or databases, you can readily find containers that come installed with the software that you need. 
In the case that there isn't an existing container for your needs, you might next look to well-maintained tools to help with `Dockerfile` generation.
Well maintained means that recent container bases are used, likely from the official Docker library [@docker_inc_official_2019], to ensure that the container has the most recent security fixes for the operating system in question.
As an example, repo2docker [@jupyter_binder_2018] is a tool that is maintained by Jupyter Labs that can help to transform a repository in the format of some known kind of package (notebook, Python, R, etc.) into a container.
Such a package contains well-defined files for defining software dependencies and versions, which repo2docker can understand.
As an example, we might install `jupyter-repo2docker` and then run it against a repository with a `requirements.txt` file, an indication of being a Python package with the following command.

```bash
jupyter-repo2docker https://github.com/norvig/pytudes
```

The resulting container image would install the dependencies listed in the requirements file, along with providing an entrypoint to run a notebook server to easily interact with any existing workflows in the repository.
A precaution that needs to be taken is that the default command above will create a home for the current user, meaning that the container itself wouldn't be ideal to share, but rather any researchers interested in interaction with the code inside should build their own container.
For this reason, it's good practice to look at any help command provided by the tool and check for configuration options for user names, user ids, and similar.
It's also recommended (if you are able) to add custom labels to your container build to define metadata for your analyses (see Rule&nbsp;6).
The container should be built to be optimized for its use case, whether it is intended to be shared or used by a single user.

Further assisting tools are `containerit` [@nust_containerit_2019] and `dockta` [@stencila_dockta_2019].
`containerit` automates the generation of standalone Dockerfiles for workflows in R.
It can provide a starting point for users unfamiliar with writing Dockerfiles, or together with other R packages provide a full image creation and execution process without having to leave an R session.
`dockta` supports multiple programming languages and configurations files, just as `repo2docker`, but attempts to create readable Dockerfiles compatible with plain Docker and to improve user experience by cleverly adjusting instructions to reduce build time.

However, in the case that a tool or interactive container environment is not available, or their capabilities to configure specific resources or install bespoke tools, you will likely need to write a `Dockerfile` from scratch.
In this case, proceed with following the remaining rules to write your `Dockerfile`.

# 2. Use versioned and automatically built base images {-}

It's good practice to use base images that are maintained by the Docker library.
While some organizations can be trustworthy in terms of content, and reliable to update containers with security fixes (e.g., `rocker/r-ver`), for most individual accounts that build containers, it's likely that containers will not be updated regularly.
It is even possible that images or Dockerfiles disappear.
Therefore a good understanding of how base images and image tags work is crucial, as the tag that you choose has implications for your container build.
You should know how to use `FROM` statements to trace all the way up to the original container base, an abstract base called `scratch`.
Doing this kind of trace is essential to be able to be aware of all of the steps that were taken to generate your container and who took them.
If you want to build on a third party image, carefully consider the author/maintainer and _never_ use an image without a published Dockerfile.
If you want to use an unofficial image, do save a copy of the Dockerfile(s) created by others.
Alternatively copy relevant instructions into your own Dockerfile, acknowledge the source in a comment, and configure an automated build for your own image.

A tag like `latest` is good in that security fixes and updates are likely present, however it is bad in that it's a moving target so that it is more likely that an updated base could break your workflow.
Other tags that should be avoided are `dev`, `devel`, or `nightly` that may provide possibly unstable versions of the software.
As an example, the Python container on Docker Hub will be released with new versions of Python.
If you build a container with `python:latest` that only supports Python version 3, when the base is updated to Python 4 it's likely that your software won't work as expected. 
In this case, a tag like `python:3.5` might be a good choice, where the third component of the version, i.e., `3.5.x`, ensures that security patches and bugfixes that won't break your code, i.e., changes that are backwards compatible, are applied (cf. semantic versioning, [@preston-werner_semantic_2013]).
When you choose a base image, choose one with a Linux distribution that supports the software stack you are using, and also take into account the bases that are widely used by your community.
As an example, Ubuntu is heavily used for geospatial research, and so the `rocker/geospatial` image would be a good choice for spatial data science with R, or `jupyter/tensorflow-notebook` could be a good choice for machine learning with Python.
Especially when data is involved, containers can grow quickly in size, and you should keep this in mind.
If you need to built smaller containers, consider a `busybox` base or a multi-stage build, which allows to selectively keep files from one build step to another.
Smaller images often are indicated by having `slim` or `minimal` as part of the tag.
Also take into account the libraries that you actually need.
Base images that have complex software installed (e.g. machine learning libraries, specific BLAS library) are helpful and fine to use.
If you do not want to rely on a third party or other individual to maintain the recipe and container, you should copy the Dockerfile to your own repository, and also provide a deployment for it via your own automated build. 
Trusting that the third party `Dockerfile` will persist for your analyses is a risky thing to do.
For the new user, a potential list of existing communities with regular builds and updates includes:

- [Rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org/) for R [@boettiger_introduction_2017]
- [Docker containers for Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/help/docker/) for bioinformatics
- [NeuroDebian images](https://hub.docker.com/_/neurodebian) for neuroscience [@halchenko_open_2012]
- [Jupyter Docker Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html for Notebook-based computing
- [Taverna Server](https://hub.docker.com/r/taverna/taverna-server) for running Taverna workflows

For example, here is how we would use a base image `r-ver` with tag `3.5.2` from the `rocker` organization on Docker Hub (`docker.io`).

```
FROM rocker/r-ver:3.5.2
```

# 3. Use formatting, document within, and favor clarity

It's good practice to think of the `Dockerfile` as being human _and_ machine readable. 
This means that you should use indentation, newlines, and comments to make your `Dockerfile`s well documented and give them readability.
Specifically, carefully indent commands and their arguments to make clear what belongs together, especially when connecting multiple commands in a `RUN` instruction with `&&`.
Use `\` to break a single command into multiple lines to ensure that no single line gets too long, and use long versions of parameters for readability (e.g., `--input` instead of `-i`).
When you need to change a directory, use `WORKDIR`, because it not only creates the directory if it doesn't exist but also persist the change across multiple `RUN` instructions.

You can use a linter [@wikipedia_contributors_lint_2019] to avoid small mistakes and follow good practices from software development communities.
The consistency added by linting also helps keeping your edits to a Dockerfile in a VCS meaningful (see Rule&nbsp;9).
Note however that a linter's rules may not primarily serve the intention of reproducible scientific workflows.

As you are writing the `Dockerfile`, put yourself in the shoes of the next user of it.
Are the choices made and commands being executed clear, or is further comment warranted?
When appropriate, you can add links to online forums, code repository issues, or VCS commit message about specific usage and decisions.
Dependencies can be grouped in this fashion, which also makes it easier to spot changes if your Dockerfile is managed in a VCS (see Rule&nbsp;9).
It can even be helpful to include comments about possibly more intuitive commands that did not work so you do not fall into the same trap twice.
If you find that you need to remember an undocumented step, that's an indication that it should be documented.

Labels are useful to provide a more structured form of documentation about software.
For example, software versions, maintainer contact information, along with vendor specific metadata are commonly seen and the OCI Image Format Specification provides some common label keys [@opencontainers_image-spec_2017].

Comments can also include usage guides, which can be helpful to others and a future you. 
As an example, it's helpful to provide commented lines with `docker build` and `docker run` within the `Dockerfile` to show how to build and run the image.
These comments can be especially relevant if volume mounts or ports are important for using the container, and by putting them at the end of the file, they are more likely to be seen, easy to copy paste after a container build, and to be in consistent state compared to documentation in another file.
Here is an example of a commented section to show build and usage.

```
# Build the images with
##> docker build --tag great_workflow .
# Run the image:
##> docker run --it --port 80:80 --volume ./input:/input --name gwf great_workflow
# Extract the data:
##> docker cp gwf:/output/ ./output
```

If you were to discover a previously written `Dockerfile` and not remember the container identifier you used, it would be represented in the `Dockerfile` in the `--name` CLI parameter.
Following a common coding aphorism, we might say _"A Dockerfile written three months ago may just as well have been written by someone else"_.
Here is an example of various kinds of comments that might be useful for a `Dockerfile`:

```
# apt-get install specific version, use 'apt-cache madison <pkg>' to see available versions
RUN apt-get install python3-pandas=0.23.3+dfsg-4ubuntu1

# RUN command spreading several lines
RUN R -e 'getOption("repos")' && \
  install2.r \
    fortunes \
    here

# this library must be installed from source to get version newer than in sources

# following commands from instructions at LINK HERE
```

Clarity is always more important than brevity.
For example, if your container uses a script to run a complex install routine, instead of removing it from the container upon completion, which is commonly seen in production Dockerfiles aiming at small image size, you should keep the script in the container for a future user to inspect.
Depending on the used programming language, your project may already contain files to manage dependencies and you may use a package manager to control this aspect of the computing environment.
This is a very good practice and helpful, though you should cautiously consider the externalisation of content to outside of the Dockerfile (see Rule 4).
A long Dockerfile with secions and helpful comments can be complete and thus more understandable than a collection of files.

Generally, try to design the `RUN` statements so that each performs one scoped action (e.g., download, compile, and install one tool).
Each statement will result in a new layer, and reasonably grouped changes increase readability of the Dockerfile and facilitate inspection of the image, e.g. with tools like dive [@goodman_dive_2019].
If a `RUN` statement is longer than a page and requires scrolling, this may be challenging for the next reader to digest, and you should consider splitting it up into several.
When you install several system libraries, it's good practice to add comments about why the dependencies are needed. 
This way, if a piece of software is removed from the container, it will be easier to remove the system dependencies that are no longer needed.
If you intend to build the image more than once (perhaps during development) and you can take advantage of build caching to avoid execution of time-consuming instructions, e.g., install from a remote resource or a file that gets cached.
You should list commands _in order_ of least likely to change to most likely to change and use the `--no-cache` flag to force a re-build of all layers.
A recommended ordering based on this metric might be:

1. system libraries
2. language-specific libraries or modules
  1. from repositories (binaries)
  2. from source
3. own software/scripts (if not mounted)
4. labels
5. `RUN`/`ENTRYPOINT`

Finally, as a supplement to content inside the `Dockerfile`, it's good practice to also write a section in a README alongside the Dockerfile for exactly how to build, run, and otherwise interact with the container. 
If a pre-built image is provided on Docker Hub, you should direct the user to it.

# 4. Pin versions {-}

The reproducibility of your `Dockerfile` is heavily dependent on how well you define versions for dependencies inside.

## System libraries

System library versions can largely come from the base image tag that you choose to use (e.g., `ubuntu:18.04`) however, you can also install specific versions of system packages with the respective package manager. 
This practice is called version pinning (e.g., on apt: https://blog.backslasher.net/my-pinning-guidelines.html).
Version pinning is good practice if the version is relevant.
For example, you might want to demonstrate a bug, prevent a bug in an updated version, or pin a working version if you suspect an update could lead to a problem.
Generally, system libraries are more stable than software modules supporting analysis scripts, but in some cases they can be highly relevant to your workflow.
_Installing from source_ is a useful way to install very specific versions, however it comes at the cost of needing build libraries.
Here is how you might go about listing the currently installed versions of software on your system:

- Debian/Ubuntu: `dpkg --list`
- Alpine: `apk -vv info|sort`
- CentOS: `yum list installed` or `rpm -qa`

## Extension packages and programming language modules

In the case of needing to install packages or dependencies for a specific language, package managers are a good option.
Package managers generally provide reliable mirrors or endpoints to download software, and many packages are tested before release.
Most package managers have a client (CLI) interface that can easily be used from `RUN` commands in your `Dockerfile`, along with various flavors of "freeze" commands that can output a text file listing all software packages and versions (cf. https://markwoodbridge.com/2017/03/05/jupyter-reproducible-science.html cited by @rule_ten_2019)
The biggest risk with using package managers with respect to `Dockerfile`s is outsourcing configuration to file formats that are supported. 
As an example, here are configuration files supported by commonly used languages in scientific programming:

- Python: `requirements.txt` (pip tool, @the_python_software_foundation_requirements_2019), `environment.yml` (Conda, @continuum_analytics_managing_2017)
- R: `DESCRIPTION` file format [@r_core_team_description_1999] and `r` ("littler", @eddelbuettel_littler_2019)
- JavaScript: `package.json` of `npm` [@npm_creating_2019]
- Julia: `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` [@julia_tomls_2019]

In some cases (e.g., Conda) the package manager is also able to make decisions about what versions to install, which is likely to lead to a non-reproducible build.
In all of the above, the user is required to inspect the file or the build to see what is installed.
For this reason, in the case of having few packages, it is suggested to write the install steps and versions directly into the `Dockerfile` (also for clarity, see Rule 3).
For example, the `RUN` statement here:

```bash
RUN pip install geopy==1.20.0 && \
    pip install uszipcode==0.2.2
```
serves as more clear documentation in a `Dockerfile` than a `requirements.txt` file that lists the same:

```bash
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This modularisation is a potential risk for understandability and consistency (cf. Rule 3), which can be mitigated by putting all these files in the same version-controlled project and their conscious usage.
The version pinning capabilities of these file formats are described in the respective documentations.

# 5. Mount data and control code {-}

Do not put data and workflow configuration or code only into the container.
It is better to _bind_, or _mount_, these files from the host machine into the container, and using the container image primarily for the software and dependencies that are not specific to the project at hand.
This is especially the case if the container is intended to be used as an interactive environment.
This ensures that data persists when the container instance or image is removed from your system.
When publishing your workspace, e.g. on Zenodo, having the crucial content as regular files outside of the container makes them more accessible to others, for example for reuse by researchers or analysis by preservationists.
Be cautious about what volumes are bound to the host, because many applications generate log and other output files during runtime.

How you bind external resources into the container should be included in the example commands (see Rule 3).
In these commands you can also make sure to avoid issues with file permissions by using Docker's `--user` option.
For example, by default writing a new file from inside the container will be owned by user `root` on your host, because that is the default user within the container.

Only in specific cases is it feasible to add data or code into the container using `ADD`/`COPY`. 
For example, small data files and software that is essential for the function of a container to distribute a reproducible analysis is essential to add.
If (part of) the software developed for a specific analysis is published as a proper package you should follow Rule&nbsp;4 for installing it from a public repository, but may install it from source after copying it into the image.
The other logical case to bind mount code is when your data is very large (usually over hundreds of GB) or has limited access. 
For example, a private dataset with personal health information should never be added to an image. 
In these cases, you should provide clear instructions to the user in the README for how to obtain actual or dummy data.

# 6. Capture environment metadata {-}

Labels and build arguments can be very helpful to both provide metadata and allow for customization of a build.

## Labels

Labels serve as structured metadata that can be exposed by APIs, e.g., https://microbadger.com/labels, along with tools to inspect the container binaries, e.g., `docker inspect`.
Namespaced conventions have been developed (http://label-schema.org/rc1/ respectively https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) to help standardize across container tools.
Important metadata attributes to include as labels would include any of the following, ideally with globally unique identifiers:

- Author and contact (e.g. email, project website; identified by a DOI; you will often see the deprecated `MAINTAINER` instruction - use a label instead
- Research organizations (identified with https://ror.org/)
- Funding agency/grant number
- A repository link where Dockerfile is published, e.g. a GitHub project or a repository record with a DOI, e.g., Zenodo, where you can pre-register a DOI and add it to your Dockerfile before publishing the record
- License

There are several projects (https://codemeta.github.io/, https://citation-file-format.github.io/) focused around metadata citation, and you should consider using one if it seems appropriate for your use case.

## Build arguments

Build arguments can provide more dynamic metadata and also allow for customization of a build.
As an example, the following build argument would default to `1.0.0` but allow you to change it with `--build-arg MYVERSION=2.0.0` when building the image:

```
ARG MYVERSION=1.0.0
```

Along with specifying versions, e.g., a git commit hash, or adding a date and timestamp, build arguments can be useful to provide the context of the build, e.g., building user, production versus development environment, and automated or not.
Examples of build arguments that are useful to include to describe a container are:

# 7. Enable interactive usage and one-click execution {-}

The success of a container can sometimes come down to how well it exposes its usage and software to the user: a function that comes down to the `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`.
By using `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`, you can use automated and manual testing to ensure that it is possible to run the container interactively _and_ given that execution is done incorrectly or has an error, a suitable help or error message is shown to assist the user.
A possible weakness with using containers is the limitation on only providing one entrypoint, however tools (e.g., The Scientific Filesystem REF academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/7/5/giy023/4931737) have been developed to expose multiple entrypoints, environments, help messages, labels, and even install sequences.
It's considered good practice to have an entrypoint that meets the user expectations. 
For example, a container known to be a workflow should execute the workflow, or spit out usage for how to do so.
An interactive container should spin up an analysis environment, ensuring to print to the screen the ports that are being used (that need to be bound to the host) along with any login credentials needed.
Using a browser to expose a user interface (e.g, RStudio, Jupyter, web tools) on a particular port is a commonly done practice, and for systems without native `x11` support, `x11docker` is recommended [REF].
Otherwise, you would need to clearly document how the user can start and control the graphical interfaces provided inside.
However, headless execution is ideal in that it can be tested without a graphical interface, either by starting or interacting with the container and checking for successful responses (e.g., 200) from endpoints provided, or by using a controller such as Selenium [REF].
To support both "one click execution" and to allow for custom configuration, it's helpful to provide users with a configuration file, or allow for settings to be expressed via environment variables [@knoth_reproducibility_2017], or special Docker-based wrappers such as Kliko [@molenaar_klikoscientific_2018].

# 8. Establish templates for new projects {-}

It's likely going to be the case that over time you will develop workflows that are similar in nature to one another.
In this case, you should consider adopting a standard workflow that will give you a clean slate for a new project.
If you decide to build your own standard, share it openly with your community to collaborate on making it better.

As an example, cookie cutter templates [@cookiecutter_contributors_cookiecutter_2019], project starter kits [REF], or community templates (e.g. [@marwick_rrtools_2019]) can provide files, directory organization, and build instructions that include basic steps for getting started.
A good project template should get you started with a template for documentation, setting up testing via continuous integration (CI), building a container, and even choosing a license.
In the case of using a common `Dockerfile` or base, Docker's build caching will take shared lines into account and speed up build time even between projects.
It also must be noted that developing or working on projects with containers, allows you to easily switch between isolated project environments by stopping the container and restart it when you are ready to work again, even on another machine or in a cloud environment.
You can even run projects in parallel without interference.
At most, if a port is shared by two projects to expose a user interface in the browser, you would need to configure unconflicting ports.

In the case of more complex web applications that require application and web servers, databases, and workers or messenging, the entire infrastructure can easily be brought up or down with an orchestration tool like `docker-compose` [@docker-compose_2019].
`docker-compose` also allows definition of services using multiple containers via it's own `docker-compose.yml` file.
The options range from mounted volumes, to permissions, environment variable, to exposed ports.
Part of this project template should be a protocol for publishing the container image to a suitable container registry, and taking into consideration of how the code can be given a DOI or proper publication (e.g., Zenodo, Journal of Open Source Software).

# 9. Publish a Dockerfile per project in a code repository with version control {-}

The `Dockerfile` is a plain text-based format and thus fits nicely into a version control system.
Including a `Dockerfile` alongside your workflow's code and (if size permits) data is an effective way to consistently build your software, to show visitors of the repository how it's built and used, to solicit feedback and collaborate with your peers, and to increase chances of preservation of your work (cf. @emsley_framework_2018).
Online collaboration platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) also make it easy to use CI services to test building your image in a second build environment, which increases stability and trust, and to publish images automatically.
If your `Dockerfile` includes an interactive user interface, you can also adapt it so that it is ready-to-use as a Binder [@jupyter_binder_2018], providing an online work environment to any user with a simple click of a link.
Furthermore, the commit messages keep a record of notes alongside all changes to the file.

While there are exceptions to the rule (cf. @kim_bio-docklets_2017), it's generally a simple and clear approach to provide one Dockerfile per project.
If you find that you need to provide more than one, use `docker-compose` and consider if it's possible to use build arguments to flip between states (e.g., development vs. production, see Rule&nbsp;6) or to separate tools into different repositories.

# 10. Use the container daily, rebuild the image weekly, clean up and preserve if need be {-}

Using containers for research workflows does not only require technical understanding, but also an awareness of risks that can only be answered by following a number of _habits_.
While there is no hardened rule, it would be good practice to rebuild a container every once or two weeks that you use on a daily basis, and to save a copy of the image in a public data repository on publication of the research project.

First, use your container every time you work on a project and not just as a final step during publication.
If the container is the only platform you use, the confidence in proper documentation of the computing environment can be very high [@marwick_readme_2015].
You should prioritize this usage over others, e.g., non-interactive execution of a full workflow, because it give you personally the highest value and does not limit your use or other's use of your data and code at all (see Rule&nbsp;7).

Second, for reproducibility, we can adopt the intentions of the cattle vs. pets meme [@bias_history_2016] and not only be unattached to a particular container but even intentionally rebuild an image at regular intervals.
In an idealistic world, containers that we built years ago should rebuild seamlessly, but this isn't necessarily the case, especially with rapidly changing technology relevant to machine learning and data science.
It can almost be guaranteed that the longer that you wait to recompile the image, the harder it will become.
If you are using an interactive container and find that you need to manually install a package or change a parameter, it would be best practice to add this dependency to the container and rebuild it rightaway, but one tends to take shortcuts.
Therefore, a habitual deletion of a container and cache-less rebuild of the used image not only increase security due to updated underlying software, it most importantly lets you realise breaks through manual interference, i.e., changes to code or configuration not mirrored in the `Dockerfile`, or though software updates early.
This way you are most likely to remember what you did. or to easily find documentation about breaking changes in used tools.
This habit may be augmented by continuous deployment or CI strategies.
If the container is linked to an automated build, simply pushing the `Dockerfile` to a VCS can easily trigger the build and ideally a simple validating execution.

In the case of needing setup or configuration for the first two habits, it's good practice to provide a `Makefile` alongside your container, which can capture the specific commands.
The effective usage of a `Makefile` also helps avoiding any undocumented steps or manual, extra commands to be run on the local machine.
A fully scripted configuration makes it easier for both you and future users, and can increase trust in your workflow.

Third, from time to time you can reduce the system resources occupied by Docker images and their layers or unused containers, volumes and networks by running `docker system prune --all`.
After a prune is performed, it would follow naturally to rebuild a container for local usage, or to pull it again from a newly built registry image.
This habit may even be automated with a cron job [@wikipedia_contributors_cron_2019].

Fourth, you may export the image to file and deposit it in a public data repository, where it not only becomes citable but also provides a real snapshot of the _actual_ environment you used at a specific point in time.
You should include instructions how to import and run the workflow based on the image archive.
Depositing the image with other project files (data, code, `Dockerfile`) in a public repository makes them likely to be preserved.
Applying proper preservation strategies (cf. [@emsley_framework_2018]) is probably beyond your grasp, but simply running an image "as-is", i.e. with the default command and entrypoint (see Rule&nbsp;7), and observing the output is quite likely to work in the future.
If the image does not work anymore, a user can still extract the image contents and explore the files of each layer manually, or if an import still works with exploration tools like dive [@goodman_dive_2019].
However, if you want to ensure usability and extendability, then you could run import, run, and export an image regularly to make sure the export format still works with the then current version of Docker.
The exported image and a version controlled `Dockerfile` together allow you to freely experiment and continue development of your workflow and keeping the image up to date, e.g., updating versions of pinned dependencies (see Rule&nbsp;4) and regular image building (see above).

Finally, for a sanity check and even higher trust in the stability and documentation, you can ask a colleague or community member to be your code copilot (see [https://twitter.com/Code_Copilot](https://twitter.com/Code_Copilot)) to interact with your workflow container on a machine of their own.
This you can do shortly before submitting your reproducible workflow to peer-review, so you are very well prepared for the future of scholarly communication and Open Science [@eglen_codecheck_2019; @chen_open_2019; @schonbrodt_training_2019; @eglen_recent_2018].

# Example Dockerfiles

To demonstrate the ten rules, we maintain a GitHub repository with example `Dockerfile`s, some of which we took from public repositories and updated to adhere to the rules (see `Dockerfile.original`): [https://github.com/nuest/ten-simple-rules-dockerfiles/](https://github.com/nuest/ten-simple-rules-dockerfiles/)

# Conclusion {#conclusion .unnumbered}

Reproducibility in research is an endeavour of best efforts, not about achieving the perfect solution, which may be not achievable or the definition of which may change over time.
This article provides guidance for using `Dockerfile`s in computational/computer-based research to work towards a "time capsule" [@blank_twitter_2019] which, given some expertise and the right tools, can be used to come as close as possible to the original workflow with reasonably small efforts.
Even if such a capsule decays over time, the effort to create it provides incredibly useful and valuable transparency for the project.
The author's work should also be valued by others and may change the way scholars communicate (cf. notion of "preproducibility" by @stark_before_2018).
So please, don't go insane with writing `Dockerfile`s, but be realistic about what might break and what is unlikely to break, and make a best effort with your current knowledge.
In a similar vein, the rules may be broken if another way works better _for your use case_.
Most importantly, share and exchange your `Dockerfile` freely and collaborate in your community to spread the knowledge about containers as a tool for research and scholarly collaboration and communication.
Together you can develop common practices and shared images for higher transparency, better effectivity, and faster innovation.
